    <h1>My Music Player</h1>
    <P>Music is a kind of expressing our feelings. It really does wonders in many people's life. It multiplies the happiness and divides your depression. It completely changes the state of mind. We feel the moment whether happy or sad when we hear to such type of music. And it helps in recovering the people who are completely depressed and who lost hope in life. Listening to music is really good for our mental and physical health. And it is not bad until we hear good type of music. I would say that music is something that expresses your emotions and shows you the beauty of harmony, peace, love and care. It brings out a better world to you. But still some people feel it is bad too because nowadays the beauty of music has decreased. The latest hits has no greater meaning or value and change the mental state of the youth. Many become so addictive to such kind of music which gives them nothing other than losing their peace and healthy mental state of mind. So think about it. You would really feel it as a gift of God.

<h2>Soft Music</h2>

  "so ft" or "light" music refers more to the genre. "soft" suggest relaxing, soothing, perhaps nighttime music e.g. slow piano music. "light" suggests it is not serious. It may make you feel happy, a bit lively and could cheer you up. A good example is the whole genre of classical music called "(British) light music".</p>
